# SEEDtk Adapter

## Overview

This module is an adapter to provide a FIG_Config.pm file for the code from the
[SEEDtk](https://github.com/SEEDtk) modules that need it when interating such modules into a BV-BRC build.

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).
